		<p>Data suggests that currently India is unable to provide enough energy during peak con-sumption hours -falling short by as much as 12 percent. In addition to meeting current energy demands, there is also a push to supply energy to the estimated 400 million Indians who currently have no electricity at all, or have just enough to power their lights. Even among the 60% who do have electricity, many have just 100 kilowatts an hour per person per year, enough only for lights to function. “They need at least 600 to 700 kilowatts an hour so that productivity can be enhanced, gross domestic product can increase and India can become more competitive,” said Kandeh Yumkella, director general of the U.N. Industrial Development Organization.

			Chulhas are an inefficient source of energy, their burning contributing to 300,000 to 400,000 deaths in India due to indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning every year. The resultant pollu-tants, between 5 to 15 times higher than industrial combustion of coal, affect outdoor air quality, haze and smog, cause chronic health problems, damage to forests, eco-systems and global climate. Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop,  unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably availa-ble and widely adopted in rural and urban India.
