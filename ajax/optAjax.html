		Energy availability, access and generation, particularly from renewable sources, has been given an impetus through Government initiatives. In India an estimated 364 million people live without access to electricity, indicating a need for enormous efforts to ensure energy efficiency. While addressing the global need of the hour by enabling more effective use of a valuable resource, energy optimisation also presents a cost saving opportunity in the face of soaring energy bills.
