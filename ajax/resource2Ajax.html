			The most competent solar power expert, (according to a research team from Tel Aviv Uni-versity) is the humble common Oriental hornet.

			The hornet utilizes solar power much like a plant and produces electricity. Think howmuch easier it would be if only we could unravel how the hornet manages it. This discovery could revolutionise future solar power harvesting.

				<p>The Heliotrope in Freiburg was the first building in the world to create more energy than it uses, of which is entirely renewable, emissions free and CO2 neutral. The structure physically rotates to track the sun, which allows it to harness the maximum natural sunlight and warmth possible. Several different energy generation modules are used in the building including a 603 sq ft (56.0 m2) dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel, a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar-thermal balcony railings to provide heat and warm water. These in-novations in combination with the superior insulation of the residence allow the Heliotrope to produce anywhere between four to six times its energy usage depending on the time of year.

				  Sailboats and sailing ships have been using wind power for over at least 5,500 years.  The wind wheel of the Greek engineer Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD is the earliest known instance of using a wind-driven wheel to power a machine – a musical organ. Another early example of a wind-driven wheel was the prayer wheel, which was used in ancient Tibet and China since the 4th century. The first practical windmills were in use in Sistan, a region in Iran and bordering Afghanistan, possibly as early as the 7th century. These windmills were used to grind corn and pump water, and in the grist milling and sugarcane industries.[5] The use of windmills became widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and India.
